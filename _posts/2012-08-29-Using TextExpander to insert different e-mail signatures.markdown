Great TextExpander tip from [Systematic episode
3](http://5by5.tv/systematic/3) for inserting different e-mail signatures:

* **-=** expands to a minimal sign off (e.g. -- Rhyd)
* **\--=** expands to a more verbose sign off (e.g. as above but with more contact info)
* **\---=** expands to my work e-mail signature

[TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/) is one of my favourite
apps. 13 hours typing saved so far.
