<p>I like thinking. So much so it seems that after writing this introductory, 3-word sentence I stopped to think about whether I want to start this post in this fashion. Good news is, I do. Hooray. Where was I? Ah, yes. Thinking.</p>

<p><em>LENGTHY PAUSE FOR THOUGHT</em></p>

<p>So, it's patently clear that everyone requires some level of thought in their day to day lives, I've setup a "Thinking" OmniFocus context for stuff that requires further thought or analysis.   </p>

<p>The problem, however, is that thinking is <strong>hard work</strong>. I regularly review this list but the outcome is always the same: I shake my head (figuratively) and decide that there's clearly something more important I could be doing.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I realised what the impasse is: I need a suitable environment to, y'know, <em>think</em>. Sitting at my desk or on the train into London staring at my Mac is not going to get the cogs whirling. So, the solution I'm trying is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>write each action from my Thinking context onto an index card</li>
<li>put these in my pocket (<em>right pocket, always the right</em>)</li>
<li>go for a non-distracted 20 min walk (no listening to music or podcasts - this bit's important)</li>
<li>look at the first card whilst walking (watch out for lamp posts)</li>
<li>think it through</li>
<li>repeat with the next card</li>
</ul>

<p>I've had an annoying, seemingly trivial admin task stuck in Thinking for the past 3 weeks which I couldn't make any headway on. A walk out of the office and, lo and behold, I solved the problem in 2 mins.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to today's walk.</p>
