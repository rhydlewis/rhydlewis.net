<p>I pushed an update to the <a href="https://github.com/mrpraline/omnivisualiser">OmniVisualiser</a> project yesterday (see <a href="http://rhydlewis.net/2012/9/3/exporting-omnifocus-as-an-opml-file">this post</a> for details). You can export OmniFocus data as OPML (as before) or as a JSON string. You can also choose whether to include dropped folders/projects and/or completed actions/projects.</p>

<p>More info available via the <a href="https://github.com/rhyd/omnivisualiser/blob/master/README.md">GitHub README</a>. </p>
