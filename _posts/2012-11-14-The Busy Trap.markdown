Tim Kreider's "The Busy Trap" is one of the best pieces of commentary I've read this year. My favourite quote:

> More and more people in this country no longer make or do anything tangible; if your job wasn’t performed by a cat or a boa constrictor in a Richard Scarry book I’m not sure I believe it’s necessary.
