[Back to Work's](http://5by5.tv/b2w) intro to GTD series has been a good recap
on the GTD methodology. With only 1 episode remaining
([#99](http://5by5.tv/b2w/99)), one of the discussions poi nts from the tail
end of episode [#98](http://5by5.tv/b2w/98) struck a chord with me:

> I can't or I won't?

I've found myself justifying the deferral of tasks or projects during reviews
with excuses such as "you can't do that because there's too much going on at
work" or "you can't do that because you need to do X instead".

This, I now realise, is a _fallacy_. I've been defering stuff because I won't
do them rather than I'm unable to do them. The fun part now - with this
realisation in mind - is to look at the reasons why I'm choosing not to do
them.
