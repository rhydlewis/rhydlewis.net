<p>I'm pretty confident that I know what I should - and shouldn't - be doing at a given time. I keep my OmniFocus setup clean, carry out daily reviews (<a href="http://gridwriter.com/2012/11/14/omnifocus-series-flags-due-dates-daily-review/">some good thoughts on this</a>) instead of weekly and, generally, I feel unencumbered by stress when I leave work for home. </p>

<p>However, I've struggled in the last couple of weeks: </p>

<ul>
<li>5am starts? Check. </li>
<li>Returning home late? Yah. </li>
<li>Stress/general feelings of anxiety? You betcha.</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought that reviewing daily meant I captured everything on my mind and, therefore, I didn't need the full-blown "get everything out of your head" effort each week. </p>

<p>Turns out not to be true and I was stressed out for 4 weeks until I understood why. I first attempted to fix this problem by adding a one-off task to OmniFocus called "go somewhere and complete a quick brain sweep". This lay dormant for days as I repeatedly reviewed it and chose not to do it. Then I worked out why:</p>

<ol>
<li>I was subconsciously afraid of capturing all the built up "stuff" in my head and the effort required to deal with it</li>
<li>The title of the task was poor, I wasn't specific about <em>where</em> I had to go</li>
</ol>

<p>I rewrote the task as "Go to the Nordic Bakery with your notebook/pen and capture everything that's on your mind". At lunch, I left the office, bought a strong coffee and sat down. I sat there for 30 mins and wrote and wrote and wrote. End result? Six pages of stuff, notes and strange doodles that I needed to deal with. I felt so much better afterwards: anxiety gone and I looked forward to getting stuck into my, by now very full, OmniFocus inbox.</p>

<p>I'm continuing to do daily reviews. I've also scheduled 1 session per week away from the office with just my notebook and pen. It's astonishing how much your mind appears to work against you if you let it.</p>
