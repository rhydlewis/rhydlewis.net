<p>So, I've decided to wave a less-than-fond farewell to <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a>. I've been a paid subscriber since 2011 but I no longer use it as much as I did. The software clients are bloated and the company seems more interested in selling additional services rather than fix fundamental problems such as copy and paste in plain text.</p>

<p>Well, no more I say, I've moved to <a href="http://www.simplenote.com/">SimpleNote</a> and <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvAlt</a>. To migrate my notes, I processed my:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>plain text files</strong> using <a href="http://steady.org/2013/06/19/exporting-evernote-notes-to-plain-text-files-part-1/">this post on exporting Evernote files to plain text</a> for inspiration, I wrote a ruby script to convert each individual note into a plain text file, reversed the HTML into Markdown and imported in nvAlt. It sort of worked but not really, I had to make some manual checks to ensure I didn't lose anything.</li>
<li><strong>files with attachments</strong>: I waded through 100 or so of these to check if they were worth keeping. Most weren't. I converted those that were into PDF's ready for processing.</li>
</ul>

<p>After checking all notes I expected to see was were in nvAlt, I deleted the Evernote clients from my phone, iPad &amp; Mac and then deactivated my account. </p>

<p>Onwards and upwards I say.</p>
