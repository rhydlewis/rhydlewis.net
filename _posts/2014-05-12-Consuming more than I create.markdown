title: "Consuming more than I create"

<p>I'm wasting my time. I read, listen and watch waaaaay too much 'stuff' instead of doing what I really enjoy. My list of subscribed blogs increased from 3 to 14 without me noticing. I had 9 podcasts downloading on a weekly basis but I rarely listened to all of them. I frequently check news sites for updates EVEN THOUGH I KNOW IT'S FUTILE. I look at Twitter less than I used to but still more than I'd like.</p>

<p>So, time to change: Chief of the boat, make your depth 'create more', 30 degree down bubble.</p>

<p>I created (chalk it up) a mind map that shows what I consume and what I should create. Using this, I'm going to apply limits to each 'thing' I consume, for example, I'll watch 3 TV shows but no more than this. These limits should help me focus on what's 'right' i.e. the stuff in my create list:</p>

<ul>
<li>playing guitar and piano</li>
<li>writing</li>
<li>being more active</li>
</ul>

<p>My current limits are:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 blogs (<a href="http://randsinrepose.com/">Rands In Repose</a>, <a href="http://blog.crisp.se/">Crisp's Blog</a>, <a href="http://brodzinski.com/">Pawel Brodzinski</a>, <a href="http://www.personalkanban.com/pk">Personal Kanban</a>, and <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/">Macdrifter</a>)</li>
<li>2 podcasts (<a href="http://thebuglepodcast.com">The Bugle</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/kermode">Kermode &amp; Mayo's Film Reviews</a>)</li>
<li>3 TV shows (Game of Thrones and The Trip to Italy. 1 spot freed up by recently finishing House of Cards)</li>
</ul>
