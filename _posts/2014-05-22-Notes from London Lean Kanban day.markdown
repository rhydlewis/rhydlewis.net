I attended the [London Lean Kanban Day](http://www.bcs.org/category/18004) on
28th April this year. I enjoyed the talks from people such as [Chris
Young](http://www.bcs.org/category/18004), [Liz Keogh](http://lizkeogh.com)
and [Chris McDermott](https://twitter.com/chrisvmcd).

A summary of my notes below:

  * metrics and evidence means **credibility**; you need data to back up decisions.
  * focus on **value** delivered rather than **features** delivered
  * **track blockers** as candidates for improvement
  * adopting practices and tools without understanding **why** is a **cargo cult**. Therefore, changing an organisation's underlying values is paramount to allow change to occur
  * use kanban boards to show WIP in conjunction with story and impact maps to show the big picture
  * WIP limits are equally important applied to **queues** as they are to in progress activities
  * individuals within the team must **want** to be part of the change initiative for it to succeed
  * Kanban is not the answer, kanban asks the questions. It highlights where the problems are
  * stories are equivalent to tiny rocks in the game Asteroids. They are fast, fly about quickly and too many of them means game over. This is true of agile development. However, the big rocks are equivalent to the goals or capabilities. Track and plan with these rather than a large backlog of user stories.
  * Heavyweight analysis, even in agile, means waterfall. Analysis must be lightweight.
  * **Stories with unclear acceptance criteria often are the things you should be working on now.**
