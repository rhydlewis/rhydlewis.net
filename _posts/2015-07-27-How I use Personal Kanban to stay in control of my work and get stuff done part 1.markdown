I started using Personal Kanban in 2012 to help me gain control of my work. I
felt busy but had little sense of making real progress. Using GTD to organise
my 'stuff' helped but finishing work was a challenge because I had too much on
the go at once. I read [the Personal Kanban
book](http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/personal-kanban-the-book/) and became
an instant convert.

I wanted to find out more but struggled to find many examples of real-world
usage. I hope these 2 posts prove useful for anyone in a similar situation.

**Personal what now?**

Personal Kanban has 2 simple rules:

  1. visualise your work
  2. limit your work in progress

This is an example board from the [Personal Kanban website](https://www.personalkanban.com/personal-kanban-101). You can see:

  * work visualised as cards and divided into columns
  * a Work In Progress limit of 5 for work in the _Doing_ state

Representing your work like this allows you to:

  * show what _state_ a piece of work is in by moving it from 1 column to another
  * infer relative _priorities_ based on a card's position on the board.
  * say whether work is _blocked_ or _held_.
  * know that you're doing too much at once

Compare this approach with the traditional to-do list where items can only be
_done_ or _not done_. Personal Kanban is more expressive and helps you
understand your work and limitations.

**Decisions, decisions**

I made 2 decisions when I made the switch to Personal Kanban.

_1) Physical or a virtual board?_

Virtual. A physical board needs free wall space which is often a scarcity.
Moving a physical board from location to location is a tricky beast too. The
virtual board allows me to:

  * see my work irrespective of my location
  * use other applications to interact with the board

_2) What's my initial workflow?_

The example workflow:

helps to explain the theory but doesn't represent how I get things done. I
added 2 extra columns to help:

  * _Backlog_: a repository of everything I need to do. This is a holding area to prevent me filling the _To Do_ column with too many tasks.
  * _Waiting for_: stuff that I need other people to complete before I can make the next step.

In the next post: details of my current set-up and what I've learned since I
started.
