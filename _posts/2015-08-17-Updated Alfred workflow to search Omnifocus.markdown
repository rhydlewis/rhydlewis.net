There's a new version of the Search Omnifocus workflow that supports searching & listing contexts and searching nested tasks properly.
<!--more-->
I've uploaded a new version of the [Search Omnifocus
workflow](https://github.com/rhydlewis/search-omnifocus) to
[GitHub](https://github.com/rhydlewis/search-omnifocus/releases/tag/v1.1.6).
It now supports:

  * searching/listing contexts
  * searching nested tasks properly
  * shows _No items_ when a search query has 0 results

It's fast and I'm starting to use it more as my main route into Omnifocus.
