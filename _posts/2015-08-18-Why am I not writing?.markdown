It's a good question. Clearly, I _am_ writing now but this isn't what I should
be writing, oh no. What I _should_ be writing is what I'm calling **The
Book**. I should also play the guitar more but that's for another discussion
in another time in another place.

Let's rephrase the original question to see if that helps: writing, why am I
not? Ah, that's much clearer. I think I know the answer. Let's turn to Steven
Pressfield and a quote from his book _The War of Art_:

> The more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we
have to do it.

This fear leads to an inability to make progress. Pressfield calls it
_resistance_ and says:

> the more fear we feel about a specific enterprise, the more certain we can
be that that enterprise is important to us

This describes exactly what I'm doing or, rather, what I'm _not_ doing. I
think it's time I got over myself and got stuck in.
