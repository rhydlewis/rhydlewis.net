OmniFocus 3 is out so I've updated the [Search Omnifocus](https://github.com/rhydlewis/search-omnifocus) Alfred workflow so that it works with this new version and continues to work with OmniFocus 2. 

You can switch between searching OmniFocus 2 and OmniFocus 3 by typing the keyword `use-of-2` and `use-of-3`.

**Tags**

OmniFocus 3 no longer uses contexts so the workflow allows you to search and list tags instead using `.t` and `.lt`.
