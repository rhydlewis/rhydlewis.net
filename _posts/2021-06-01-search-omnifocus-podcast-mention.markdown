Nice surprise to hear the presenters of [Automators podcast](https://www.relay.fm/automators) mention my Alfred workflow last week (thanks to [Vero](https://twitter.com/vero) from the [Alfred](https://twitter.com/alfredapp) team for letting me know).

[David Sparks](https://mobile.twitter.com/MacSparky) describes the workflow as a "game changer" and that he's "not found a faster way to get to a target location [in OmniFocus]". Thanks to [Rosemary Orchard](https://mobile.twitter.com/rosemaryorchard) for mentioning me as the author too.

David [mentions the workflow on his blog](https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2021/3/packal-alfred-omnifocus-scripts) too (albeit referred to as the Packal Search OmniFocus workflow which isn't quite correct but I'll take the referral!).
