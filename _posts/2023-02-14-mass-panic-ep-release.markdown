I set myself a target of releasing some of the music I've been working on over the last few months - actually years... - in the first quarter of this year. After spending many hours tinkering in Logic Pro, playing guitar, bass and getting lost in the myriad controls of a multitude of synthesisers, I'm pleased as punch to say that the EP is... out.

Called "**Mass Panic**", it's a collection of 4 songs that intersperse movie dialogue (and a rather outdated speech) with electronic music influenced by movie soundtracks, heavy guitars, synths and time spent daydreaming on my commute to work. I've also decided to release it under the alias **entMOOT** because it's fun making stuff like this up.

Mass Panic is available now:

* [Bandcamp - including film dialogue](https://entmootmusic.bandcamp.com/album/mass-panic)
* [Apple Music - instrumental only](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/mass-panic-ep/1671171758)
* [Spotify - instrumental only](https://open.spotify.com/album/1CKc3OXsCFRRtnwS83OO9p?si=03c3abf8a7cd4aaf)
