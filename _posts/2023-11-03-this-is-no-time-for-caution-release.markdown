I released a new [entMOOT](https://ent-moot.bandcamp.com) track called "This is No Time For Caution" on 6 October. I enjoyed making this one, it features an array of synths (including a slightly modded version of the Alchemy preset Insubstantial), bass, drums and a smattering of guitar at the end alongside dialogue from the docking scene from Interstellar.
