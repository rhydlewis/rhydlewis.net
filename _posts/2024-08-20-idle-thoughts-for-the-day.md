Stuff I thought about whilst not reading, listening to podcasts or looking at my phone whilst travelling from London St Pancras to Notting Hill Gate this morning:
* bricklaying and the different permutations brick arrangements in a wall
* the superlative adventure game Damocles I used to play on the Amiga A500
* standard: work stuff (and of course, the future)
* that scene from Westworld when Bernard finds out he's a host (so good)
* Cormac McCarthy's The Road (no specific about it, just the book)
* deliberate running without listening to audiobooks, music or podcasts
