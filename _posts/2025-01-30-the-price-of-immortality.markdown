"They" say nothing lasts forever, but after 9 months of tweaking and procrastinating, "The Price of Immortality" is finally immortalised in digital form. This new [entMOOT](https://entmootmusic.com) track has been a long journey and I'm pleased as punch that it's finally out there.

Speaking of time (and immortality), I'm slightly surprised to realize I started this [back in May 2024](https://rhydlewis.net/blog/2024/05/08/wip-entmoot-song) ðŸ˜±. The track features a rich blend of church organ, drums, synths and heavy guitars, creating a... _looks away from the screen to contemplate using a slightly grandiose term_... soundscape that I really enjoyed creating.

Finishing this one was interesting. The foundation - those church organ and synth layers - came together relatively quickly. But then I fell into that familiar trap: either endlessly tweaking guitar tones ("maybe if I just try _this_ pedal and change _that_ setting...") or avoiding it entirely by working on other tracks. Both paths, as it turns out, are equally effective at preventing completion.

Actually, this has been a perfect example of Parkinson's Law in action - work expands to fill the time available. Looking back, I probably could have completed this track much sooner if I'd set myself some stricter deadlines. It's a lesson learned for future work that I'll no doubt ignore - sometimes you need those artificial constraints to push through the lure of making _just one more_ adjustment. 

To accompany the track, I used Premiere Pro to edit the scene to match the music, and I'm really happy with how it turned out. You can check it out on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Rd5JDstMxc).
