## About the Track

This is a new score to accompany the garden scene from the classic crime drama "The Godfather". I wanted to set myself a challenge of constraining the instrumentation to just piano and strings. The song explores the tension between Vito's resignation and Michael's resolve as we witness the balance of power shift. 

I really enjoyed limiting myself on this arrangement - sometimes less is more... For the finale, I wanted the strings to return and rise to highlight the profound sadness of Don Corleone's realisation about his son's future. I like the way this has turned out.

This was a relatively quick recording compared to other recent tracks. I used [Crow Hill's Glass Strings VST](https://thecrowhillcompany.com/glass-strings/) to capture the string sections and spent most of my time trying to balance the dynamics between the two instruments to ensure they complemented rather than competed with each other.

This track forms part of my "Rescored Vol. 1" album which will come out later this year.
