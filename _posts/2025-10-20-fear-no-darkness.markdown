After six months of sitting _almost_ completed on my hard drive, "Fear No Darkness" is finally out. This new [entMOOT](https://entmootmusic.com) track rescores an iconic scenes from "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" and I think it might just be my favourite work so far.

## About the Track

This started life as a simple piano piece but something felt, well, not _right_. When something's not right, throw in some synths and guitars I say. For this track, I experimented with adding some choir — a first — which transformed the entire feel of the track and then the hi-hats come in... I thought about how to end the track and then I realised that I could revisit the early synth lead line rearranged for harmonised heavy guitars. Tricky to play but I think it works well

## The Arrangement

The instrumentation builds from electric piano and synths into an ensemble featuring choir, bass, drums and those heavy guitar harmonies. I wanted to capture both the quiet determination and then the explosive courage as the cavalry picks up speed towards the awaiting Mordor hordes (not a sentence I thought I'd ever write).

As a bonus, the single includes a b-side featuring a piano and string composition that rescores a scene from "A Few Good Men", bit of a contrast to the epic scale of the main track but there you go.

"Fear No Darkness" will be part of my upcoming "Rescored Vol. One" album.
