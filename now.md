## Right now...

I'm spinning these plates at the moment:

- reading Tim Shipman's book "Fall Out: A Year of Political Mayhem"
- multiple Logic Pro projects
- mixing a new entMOOT song
- enjoying playing acoustic guitar using a loop pedal
- working at [Equal Experts](https://www.equalexperts.com)
- training for the Paris & Manchester Marathons. Still a year away but training has definitely begun.
