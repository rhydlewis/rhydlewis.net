I've started [my own podcast](https://rethinkworklife.net) which launches tomorrow! It aims to uncover the critical and defining moments in life that make people pause, reflect and rethink how they approach work and life. 

Each week, I'll interview a guest to understand more about their life, their work and the moments that made them rethink their approach to both.

It's been fun learning how to record, edit and produce each episode as well build a website and find a hosting partner (Acast). Has taken me **much** more time than I expected but it's been enjoyable and hopefully people will find a good listen.
