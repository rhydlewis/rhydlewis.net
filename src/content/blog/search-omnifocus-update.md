I pushed a new version — let's say 1.0.13 — of the [Search OmniFocus workflow](https://github.com/rhydlewis/alfred-search-omnifocus) for Alfred today. Couple of minor updates, namely:

* updated all related packages to the latest versions (hopefully this means a banishment for the node vs better-sqllite-3 compatabilty issues)
* replaced OmniFocus icons with alternatives from the Font Awesome library

Available now and worth a look if you, like me, rely heavily on Alfred and OmniFocus.

`npm install -g alfred-search-omnifocus`
