What the blazes is this? Notes for the week at the start of the week? That's precisely what's in store. I'm listening to Jellybelly by The Smashing Pumpkins as I type (best bit: repeated snare hit at 2:03... no, it _is_).

Some classic procrastination last week as I avoided finishing 1 entMOOT song in preference of starting another. Classic. I was hooning about with a chord progression and found the sound of it worked well with a Super Saw pad. A few hours later and I had the workings of an outline. A few more hours and I'm happy with the initial results. Another few passes and it'll be ready for a mix.

Slow going on the running front. I ran a half marathon at the start of July (2h 6m - slower than I wanted but the wind was mental and I had a bit of jip with the right knee). I'll re-run the same event in November so it'll be time to start a new training plan soon.
